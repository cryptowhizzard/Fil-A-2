    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "We will store the DANDI open dataset from AWS. DANDI is a public archive of neurophysiology datasets, including raw and processed data, and associated software containers. Datasets are shared according to a Creative Commons CC0 or CC-BY licenses. The data archive provides a broad range of cellular neurophysiology data. ",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "We will use Singularity.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "This will be the AWS bucket.",
